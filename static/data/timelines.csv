The quality of the graphics themselves will also inevitably improve, such that seeing a VR environment could become indistinguishable from looking at reality.",Technology Development,High,Medium,
200,25,4,Virtual Reality Headsets,VR contact lenses developed,2035,2040,Contact lenses capable of projecting high quality images could be developed and begin to replace or act as an alternative for glasses or headsets. This could extend the portability of VR and make the experience more immersive as the image would appear closer to the eye.,Technology Development,Low,Low,
201,25,5,Virtual Reality Headsets,Psychological trauma caused by VR,2030,2035,It is possible that the quality of the visual and audio experience delivered by VR headsets could reach a stage that means that experiences within a virtual environment become capable of traumatising users. Violent games or military simulations could begin to represent a hazard to users.,Legal/Ethical,Low,Medium,
202,25,6,Virtual Reality Headsets,Substantially reduced cost of equipment,2027,2031,"The cost of lightweight VR glasses or headsets could reduce substantially which would enable the technology to move beyond its current niche status and become much more mainstream.

203,25,7,Virtual Reality Headsets,VR used to treat PTSD,2025,2030,"The quality of immersive experience delivered by VR headsets could become sufficiently high that it supports the use of VR as a means of treating PTSD, through enabling sufferers to revisit environments and experiences associated with trauma as part of the treatment process.",Defence Implication,Low,High,
204,26,0,Augmented Reality Glasses,Increased integration with device based AR,2021,2026,"There are likely to be developments in the modelling and processing underpinning AR systems which allow the coordinated synchronisation of multiple sets of AR glasses with those experiencing AR via device screens (e.g. tablets or phones). This will enable multiple individuals to have the same AR experience from different angles and through different interfaces, effectively creating a shared augmented world.",Integration,Medium,High,https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/magic-leap-1
205,26,1,Augmented Reality Glasses,Visual range and perspective delivered in AR,2022,2030,"AR glasses will probably be able to accurately track where a user is looking in the physical world and deliver augmented objects into this space in a way which completely replicates 'real' perspective and distance. This could allow the range of AR to be significantly extended, where objects can be seamlessly rendered into the background and foreground, and realistically move between the two simulating appropriate speeds. This would transform AR from a technology which currently delivers objects into the near distance, to one which could transform your entire field of view, creating simulated backgrounds (e.g. natural features or conurbations) and objects moving over long distances (e.g. vehicles).",Technology Development,High,Medium,
206,26,2,Augmented Reality Glasses,Handheld controls for AR widely used,2023,2027,"Handheld control devices could become an integral part of the AR experience, allowing users to interact with the augmented elements of AR. These wand-like devices may be similar to the hand controllers used in VR environments, or they could be similar to a mouse. They would allow users to move or stimulate augmented objects they are viewing through their glasses, and even deliver augmented effects into the view (e.g. shooting a laser).",Integration,Low,High,
207,26,3,Augmented Reality Glasses,Acceptability of glasses mounted cameras adressed,2022,2026,Resolving this issue will be critical to enabling AR experiences that are able to fully integrate and respond to the real world. It is possible that this will be legally and ethically resolved in many countries to the extent that using cameras to support certain applications (e.g. AR games) will be widely accepted by the public. This may require limits on the way information is collected and analysed for individuals who stray into the AR view without providing any consent.,Legal/Ethical,Medium,Medium,
208,26,4,Augmented Reality Glasses,Stylish glasses developed,2028,2033,"AR glasses which are indistinguishable from normal prescription glasses or sunglasses are likely to be developed. This could lead to greater adoption of smart glasses, as they come to be seen as a lightweight and acceptable fashion accessory, rather than a geeky piece of tech. This could pose a number of privacy and social interaction issues, as it becomes difficult to determine if someone is using AR or not (potentially receiving data about people with whom they are meeting).",Societal Adoption,High,High,
209,26,5,Augmented Reality Glasses,AR becomes integral to everyday life,2030,2035,"It is possible that the use of AR glasses becomes as integral a part of everyday life as is the use of smartphones. This could mean that individuals wear their glasses or have them to hand for most periods of the day, and consume content (e.g. games, directions, advertising, news) within many different settings (commuting, in the office and at home for entertainment). The widespread use of such an immersive technology could have profound impacts on the way the world around us is designed.",Societal Adoption,High,Low,
210,26,6,Augmented Reality Glasses,5G developments support ubiquitous AR,2025,2030,5G (as well as edge computing) infrastructure could develop sufficiently to enable the delivery of high quality and ubiquitous AR services to users via their glasses.

A number of issues to do with the user experience, attentional focus, the reliability of service provision and the development of the right supporting software and services will need to be addressed first. This could see most dismounted personnel in receipt of visual information (e.g. directions, data about an environment, etc.) while they perform their duties.",Defence Implication,High,Medium,
212,26,8,Augmented Reality Glasses,AR effectively integrated with haptics,2030,2035,"Haptic technologies, such as haptic suits and gloves, could be integrated with the use of AR glasses to deliver multisensory AR experiences, where individuals can feel some of the augmented environment and its objects.

This may have a dramatic effect on hearing impairment.",Technology Development,High,Medium,
217,27,4,Audio Indicators,Use of ear implants among non-hearing impaired becomes common,2035,2040,"Ear implants could be developed to enhance hearing, allowing humans to hear sounds that are currently inaudible, both in terms of pitch and volume. These may possibly be adopted by those without hearing impairments as a move towards transhumanism. The devices would be able to be modulated so that they can be turned on and off and various capabilities could be used in different situations.

220,27,7,Audio Indicators,3D sound becomes the default,2025,2030,"3D audio could become the standard way of delivering sound to listeners using most devices. Most new music could begin to be recorded using 3D sound techniques, becoming a central part of the production and artistic process. All devices would then start to be developed to better deliver 3D sound and 3D headphones would become standard.",Societal Adoption,Medium,Medium,
221,28,0,Brain Computer Interfaces,BCI implants become less invasive,2025,2028,It is likely that BCI implants will become less inherently invasive (e.g. removing the need for wires passing through the skull or solving some of the issues related to stimulating immune responses) and that the surgical procedures to position the implant will concomitantly improve. This may make the process of obtaining an implant much less risky and more commercially viable.,Technology Development,Medium,High,
222,28,1,Brain Computer Interfaces,Neurophysiology research increases BCI sophistication,2025,2030,"A combination of improvements in the understanding of brain function, signal processing capabilities and advanced data analytic techniques (drawing on new machine learning approaches) could lead to dramatic leaps in the ability to decode the brain's neural activity.

223,28,2,Brain Computer Interfaces,Effective marketing of non-invasive BCIs,2026,2030,A cleverly marketed and stylishly designed non-invasive BCI might become a trailblazer for this interface (in a similar way as occurred with Fitbits and smartwatches). This could see a dramatic increase in both public awareness and usage of BCIs. Their growth in the user community would be likely to stimulate associated services for these BCIs. Other developers would be likely to try and mimic the device developed by any early market leader.,Societal Adoption,Medium,Medium,
224,28,3,Brain Computer Interfaces,Commercial apps for BCIs developed,2028,2032,"If there were growth in the ownership of BCIs, there would also be a growth in the number of applications available to exploit this technology (as has been seen with the growth in VR gaming and the release of latest generation VR headsets). In addition to gaming, there might also be a number of applications that use input from BCIs to deliver services (in the same fashion as smart speakers have seen an increasing number of voice controlled personal assistant services). These services could range from the control of domestic appliances and environments, to ways of selecting options presented via a visual screen (e.g. selecting TV content to watch without a remote control). The fidelity of the input is likely to be insufficient to enable complex and detailed commands to be relayed.",Production,Low,Medium,

Paralysis of this kind could be effectively eradicated.",Societal Adoption,High,Medium,
226,28,5,Brain Computer Interfaces,BCI implants used more widely by general population,2035,2040,"The general public may become more willing to have BCI implants if the process becomes sufficiently safe, convenient and affordable. It could start to be perceived in the same way that laser eye surgery or even tattooing is currently seen. A greater uptake of BCI implants might open up a number of applications for human-to-human interactions. It is possible that implanted BCIs could be viewed as an accepted, and even obvious upgrade to commercially available non-invasive BCIs.",Societal Adoption,High,Low,
227,28,6,Brain Computer Interfaces,Issues arise relating to BCI data privacy,2025,2028,"The public are likely to become conscious of the privacy issues surrounding the use of BCIs, which may be portrayed by the media as being able to read minds and then relay this data to service providers. There is therefore likely to be a push to tightly regulate how this information can be stored, shared and analysed by companies handling BCI derived data. This could take the form of legislation resembling the way biometric data is treated in many cases. A single example of misuse of this data could have a dramatic impact on public perceptions and willingness to adopt the technology.",Legal/Ethical,Low,High,
228,28,7,Brain Computer Interfaces,The boundaries of mental agency are blurred,2036,2040,"AI analysis and interpretation of BCI derived data could develop to an extent that extends far beyond capturing of motor signals or enabling simple option selection. This could effectively lead to a much greater capacity to 'read' human thought. This might open up opportunities relating to interpreting complex patterns of thought, such as intent and desire, and relaying these to machines. This would pose significant challenges to our existing concepts of mental agency, where machines might be instructed to do things based on something other than conscious thought.",Legal/Ethical,High,Low,
229,28,8,Brain Computer Interfaces,BCIs used to treat mental illness,2032,2035,"BCIs could be used in the treatment of mental illness by stimulating certain parts of the brain (e.g. the reward centre) in response to changes in mood state, which are in turn detected by a BCI.

230,28,9,Brain Computer Interfaces,Sophisticated bi-directional BCIs developed,2036,2040,"It is possible that effective bi-directional systems could be developed, which allow targeted stimulation of parts of the brain. This could lead to the ability to generate non-volitional movements that are as responsive and precise as our volitional movements, allowing a human body to effectively be controlled. It could even allow brain activity to be regulated in some ways, and maybe even generate patterns of thought, although there are a large number of challenges to overcome before this would be possible.",Technology Development,High,Low,
231,28,10,Brain Computer Interfaces,Neural lace for humans successfully used,2038,2040,"Neural lace, a thin mesh like material which is injected into the brain and physically integrates directly with neurons, even adapting to changes within the brain, could be successfully trialled with human users. This technology would allow a much greater surface area of connectivity and has the potential to revolutionise the capabilities that BCIs could support.

238,29,6,Olfactory Interfaces,Scent integrated into VR,2030,2034,"In order to generate more immersive virtual environments, olfactory interfaces could become a key part of the equipment used to build these worlds. VR users may come to expect their virtual environments to deliver smell in a natural way (i.e. where directionality and intensity help to determine where the smell is coming from). These effects may be achieved through larger scent producing units, but it is more likely they will need to be delivered via person-borne interfaces, in order to overcome the problems that would be experienced in trying to dissipate scent if it were released into the room at large.",Integration,Medium,Medium,
